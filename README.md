# Code Test Responses

___

This is the repo for John Potz's responses to Tavernlight Games' coding test.

Each folder contains the files relevant to the question it is labeled with.

Unfortunately, I have currently skipped Question 6. I have worked with shaders in the past, but it has been a while and I am still re-familiarizing myself with them and how they work with this codebase.
